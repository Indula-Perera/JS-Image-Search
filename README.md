# Image Search App

This is a simple image search app that allows users to search for images using the Unsplash API. Users can input a search query, and the app will display relevant images along with links to the original source on Unsplash.

## Prerequisites

Before using this app, make sure you have your own Unsplash account and obtain your access key (API key) from the [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers) website.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-search-app.git
   cd image-search-app
   ```

2. Create a file named `config.js` in the root directory and add your Unsplash access key:

   ```javascript
   // config.js
   const accessKey = "your-access-key";
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or host the files on a web server.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. Enter a search query in the input field and click the "Search" button.

3. The app will fetch images from Unsplash and display them along with links to the original source.

4. Click on the "See More" button to load more images.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the app according to your preferences. You can modify the CSS styles in `style.css` and enhance the functionality in `script.js`.

## Note

**Important:** You need to create your own Unsplash account and obtain your access key (API key) through the [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers) site. Replace the placeholder access key in `config.js` with your actual access key.
